# OldTestamentStudent-for-Mac
OTS for MacOS provides you with a number of tools that will allow you to study either (or both of) the Masoretic Hebrew and Aramaic, as provided by the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), and Rhalfs' edition of the Septuagint (LXX).

You will be able to look at the source text on a chapter by chapter basis and it will keep a history of your recent reading pattern.  This will include the ability to copy individual words, verses, whole chapters and selected portions of text.  You can also choose whether to include accents or not and whether to add a bible reference to your copy.

OTS also parses and presents lexicon meanings to selected words, using the Brown Driver and Briggs lexicon (BDB) for BHS and Liddell & Scott (L&S) for the LXX.

You will also be able to search for all uses of a particular word, using Strongs coding as a mechanism for relating different forms of a word in the case of the BHS.  This searching capability (effectively a concordance) will include the ability to search for the occurrence of two different words within a set distance of one another.

You can also make notes against each verse.  These can be saved and you will be able to create different note sets.

The application has been developed in Objective-C in XCode and the source files have also been provided.  Installing a project from the files, as presented, hasn't been tested so you may need some manual effort to get it running in XCode.

Note also that the installation package is independant of Apple and running it will probably result in a security check by the operating system.  In case you're not sure how to respond to this, a document has been provided to explain it.

More detailed information on the application has been provided in the form of a help HTML file.
