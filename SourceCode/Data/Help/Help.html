It also    means that you can work at your computer's speed and not that of your    internet connection. (Please see the final section, <span style="font-style: italic;">Caveats
      and Compliments</span>, for a brief explanation of sources and    acknowledgements.) <br>    <br>    We'll introduce you to the different parts of the application in detail    later but let's get an overview now of what Bible Reader offers. It provides<br>    <ul>      <li>The text of the Old Testament as provided by Biblia Hebraica        Stuttgartensia, displayed for a selected chapter;</li>      <li>Alternatively, you can read Rhalfs edition of the Septuagint (the        Greek translation of the Old Testament, made around 200 BC); </li>      <li>A parse window: simply by clicking and "Analysing" a word, you can get        a grammatical analysis of that word;</li>      <li>At the same time, it will also try to give you details of how the word        was used, as provided by the BDB (Brown, Driver and Briggs) lexicon for        the Hebrew and Aramaic or Liddell &amp; Scott for the Greek;</li>      <li>A search facility allows you to get a list of all the verse where the        word is used, together with some additional sophisitcation in search        criteria;</li>      <li>A notes area: a feature that allows you to create, save and restore        notes for each verse.</li>    </ul>    So, let's look at the application in more detail.<br>    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId278659"></a>2. A Brief Overview of      what you see </h3>    When you first start the application, it will look something like this:<br>    <br>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="01%20Opening%20Window.png" alt="Opening Window"        height="897"        width="1384"></div>    <br>    Let's initially describe the different parts of this window in general    terms. There is a panel at the top of the window which we will call the    Orientation Panel. In the schematic image below, this is the area shaded in    green.<br>    <br>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="02%20Application%20Areas.png" alt="Application Areas"        height="893"        width="1186"></div>    <br>    This area is mainly to do with navigating to the desired chapter and book.<br>    <br>    The rest of the window is divided into two areas: the left panel (shaded    brown) and the right panels (shaded blue).&nbsp; We've separated out the    bottom panel (in yellow) because this adds the ability to display virtual    keyboards (Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek) for input to the Search facility and    the notes. <br>    <br>    The left panel will display the actual text and is, in reality, the heart of    the application. The right panels are a variety of sub-sections that are    mainly to do with presenting information that you ask for as you work on the    text.<br>    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId193419"></a>2.1 The Orientation Panel</h4>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="03%20Orientation%20Panel.png" alt="Orientation Panel"        height="343"        width="710"></div>    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId494456"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>2.2
      The left (Text) Pane</h4>    <p>The left text pane contains the text itself (the main point of the      application), and (in the section shown in yellow, above) a list of      references recently visited and the ability to produce a "virtual      keyboard" (see later). This is a good time to emphasise that the same is      available independantly for both the text of the BHS and the text of the      Septuagint (LXX).</p>    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId505599"></a>2.3 The Right      (Information) Area</h4>    <br>    <table style="text-align: left; width: 1213px; height: 690px;" cellspacing="2"      cellpadding="2"      border="0">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="06%20Information%20Area.png"              alt="Information Area"              height="778"              width="600"></td>          <td style="vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;">The upper half            of the pane contains a variety of panels that will provide the user            with:<br>            <ul>              <li>An area in which parse information for a selected word can be                displayed (Grammatical information);</li>              <li>An area where one or more possible Lexical entries for the                word are displayed (Lexical Information);</li>              <li>An area in which any search results are displayed.</li>            </ul>            &nbsp;We will discuss each of these in more detail below.<br>            <br>            The bottom half is quite busy and varies slightly, depending whether            you are looking at the BHS or LXX:<br>            <ul>              <li>An area in which you can record notes attached to a specific                verse;</li>              <li>An area to set up details for a search (where the results are                displayed in the Search Results pane in the top half);</li>              <li>when looking at the BHS, you can also show both the Kethib and                the Qere, where relevant;</li>              <li>when looking at the LXX, this area includes information that                may help decode some of the abbreviations used in the Liddell                &amp; Scott lexicon entries. </li>            </ul>            <br>            <br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <br>    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId455626"></a>3 The main Text Area</h3>    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId393877"></a>3.1 The Basics </h4>    It's pretty obvious what happens here:<br>    <br>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 557px; height: 301px;" alt="Navigating the Main Text Area"        title="Navigating the Main Text Area"        src="07%20Navigating%20the%20Main%20Text%20Area.jpg"></div>    <br>    You can change the book you are reading by selecting from the list in the    Book list, in the Orientation Panel. Similarly, you can change the chapter    alone by selecting from the Chapter list. Note that, if you change the <span      style="font-style: italic;">book</span>,    it will automatically reset to the first chapter of that book.<br>    <br>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 765px; height: 415px;" alt="Managing the Text"        title="Managing the Text"        src="08%20Managing%20the%20text.JPG"></div>    <br>    You can also select a specific verse from the relevant pull-down list but    there will be no visible change.<br>    <br>    If you have a note displayed for your current verse and you change this    verse reference, that note will disappear from view. (Don't worry! It will    be saved.) Similarly, if the verse you change to already has a note, then    this note will now be displayed. We'll talk about the purpose of the list of    verses and about notes later. <br>    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId250846"></a>3.2 Some Additional      Options</h4>    If you right click anywhere on the text area, a small menu will pop up:<br>    <br>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="09%20Further%20menu%20options.png"        alt="09 Further menu options"        height="668"        width="627"></div>    <p><br>      The first four application options (after <strong>Share</strong>) open a      mini-window known as a "dialog" (spelt the American way):</p>    <p align="center"> <img src="09b%20Copy%20Options%20dialog.png" alt="Copy Options dialog"        height="335"        width="730"></p>    <p align="left">Whether you are copying a single word, a verse or the whole      chapter, you will get the same dialog of options. This will allow you to      specify:</p>    <ul>      <li>whether the target destination of the copy is memory or the relevant        Notes page;</li>      <li>whether to include the reference in the copy or not;</li>      <li>whether to remove accents or not.</li>    </ul>    <p>You can also check the box to ensure that the options you select are      remembered. This will mean that future copies will automatically use the      same options. Note, however, that</p>    <ul>      <li>each copy option is treated separately (so, even if you check the box        to remember the selected options for copying a word, you <em>will</em>        be prompted with the same dialog on copying a verse);</li>      <li>the selected options are specific to the language you are currently        using (so, if you change to the other language, you will also get fresh        prompts). </li>    </ul>    <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId664164"></a>3.2.1 Copy Current Word,      Verse or Chapter to ...</h5>    <p>This will do what the image tells you.<br>      <br>      If you select Memory, this will copy the currently selected word into      memory (technically, into the "Pasteboard"). This means that you can paste      it into another application, such as a Word Processor. (If you're not sure      how to paste into your application, check its help facility, look on      Google or ask a friend.) The option to omit accents allows you to copy a      clearer version of the text, not hampered by the complex accenting system      of Hebrew or Greek.<br>      <br>      If you select Notes, it will copy the word to the notes area for the      current verse <span style="font-style: italic;">at the point where your        cursor is currently positioned</span>.<br>      <br>      When you right click to get the Context Menu, make sure that the mouse is      over the specific result and word that you are interested in.<br>      <br>      Be aware that the concept of a word in most European languages needs a      degree of refinement in Hebrew.&nbsp; We normally think of a word as a      sequence of letters (or some kind of more precise equivalent) separated      from others by spaces and/or grammatical symbols.&nbsp; It's not that easy      in Hebrew.&nbsp; Consider Genesis 25:2 and the "word":</p>    <h1 align="center"><a id="mozTocId268133" class="mozTocH1"></a>&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;
      </h1>    <p>There are two obvious components to this word: the "main" word, <big><big>&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1503;,</big></big>      a masculine noun which is, in fact, a man's name, and the component to the      right of the mappeq.&nbsp; But that's not all, this second element can be      sub-divided into the preposition, <big><big>&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;,</big></big> and the      conjunction, <big><big>&#1493;</big></big>&#1456;.&nbsp; Are these individual words      or something else that only become words when used in certain ways?&nbsp;      Well, for better or worse, they are divided into word-like units in BHS,      so be careful where you place your mouse when you open this pop-up menu.</p>    <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId510541"></a>3.2.2 Copy Selected Text      to ... </h5>    <p>You can select a small amount of text by using a click and drag      technique: click the left mouse of the button, as normal, at the place      where you want to selection to start but hold the button down rather than      letting go; then, while holding the button down, drag the mouse until it      is over the place where you want the selection to finish; then let go.      Once you have done this, you can right click anywhere in the text area and      select the menu option to copy the selected text. Note that you can also      perform this task by double-clicking, which will select a whole word, and      then dragging to select additional words.&nbsp; (Bear in mind, though, the      comments earlier on what is a word.)<br>      <br>      Note that you will be presented with the same dialog and the same options      as other copy actions. </p>    <h5><a id="mozTocId75162" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.3 Reset Copy Options </h5>    <p>If you have not chosen to remember the settings for any of the copy      options, this menu option will not be available, since you don't need      it.&nbsp; Assuming that you <em>have</em> remembered one or more copy      settings, clicking on this menu option will raise another dialog:</p>    <p align="center"><img src="09c%20Reset%20Options.png" alt="09c Reset Options"        height="445"        width="780"></p>    <p>If you have chosen to remember copy details for one or more types of copy      options, then this is the way you can get the application to prompt you      once again.

Because the text was sacred, they      stopped short of actually changing the main text so, to indicate that they      think it should be read differently, they wrote consonants of the old word      (the Kethib) but pointed it with the vowels of the new word (the Qere).      Our text always presents the Qere form but, by default, displays the word      in red.

It should be noted that the source data      sometimes identified a base form for some words that were not considered      as base forms by Liddell and Scott. A good example of this is words that      are only found as deponents in the LXX and, so, the base form would be      -&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;. If the active form is found in classical or wider Greek, Liddell      &amp; Scott may have entered this under its active form (e.g. -&#969;). We have      tried to build a number of strategies into the search process but we      cannot guarantee that all words will be identified.</p>    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId1136"></a>5 History</h3>    Old Testament Student keeps a track of passages you have previously    selected.

The question is: How do you type a Hebrew word into the    box?<br>    <br>    Probably the most useful mechanism requires a return to the text area. If    you right click on a word in the text area, a context menu option allows you    to copy that word into this box:<br>    <br>    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 655px; height: 523px;" alt="From Main Text"        title="From Main Text"        src="15%20From%20Main%20Text.png"></div>    <div align="left"><br>      If you select this menu option it will insert the selected word into the      box.<br>      <br>      <img src="16%20Resulting%20input.png" alt="16 Resulting input" height="619"        width="1312">      <br>    </div>    <div style="text-align: left;"><br>      So, with the word in the textbox, simply click on the Perform Search      button and OTS will look for all the occurrences in the OT:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="17%20Search%20Results.png" alt="17 Search Results"          height="485"          width="652"></div>      <p><br>        Notice the scroll bar to the right of the search results.

Alternatively, you can "drag" the darker        grey thumb (the small square) and drag down as much or as little as you        want.<br>        <br>        Notice also the message at the bottom of the results. This was created        while it was performing the search and is a report on progress. For        searches involving frequently used words, the progress of the search is        made visible here.&nbsp; Be patient: the application is scanning through        a lot of text and can take a little while.</p>      6.1 Being selective about which books to search You can speed up the      search if you exclude some books from the search criteria. This can be      done in a number of ways:<br>      <br>      a) <span style="font-style: italic;">Specific books</span><br>      <br>      If you click on one of the books in the listbox, it will be highlighted      (or "selected"). If you <strong>cmd</strong>+click on a second book, that      too will be selected and the first one will stay highlighted. You can      scroll through the list of books and select specific ones:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 348px; height: 302px;"          alt="Selecting specific books"          title="Selecting specific books"          src="18%20Selecting%20specific%20books.png"></div>      <br>      If we now click on the Remove Selected Books, OTS will remove those books      from the search criteria:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 348px; height: 302px;"          alt="Specific books gone"          title="Specific books gone"          src="19%20Specific%20books%20gone.png"></div>      <br>      Look carefully and you will see that the three selected books are no      longer in the list. Incidentally, if you clicked on a book in error and it      was selected, simply <strong>cmd</strong>+click on it again and it will      be un-selected,<br>      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId52332"></a>6.2 Excluding and        including whole collections of books</h4>      If I want to exclude whole groups of books, I can use the check boxes to      the right of the book list. Imagine, for example, that I don't want to      search the books of Moses. Then, I can simply click on the checkbox, <span        style="font-weight: bold;">Pentateuch</span>      and they will disappear from the list:<br>      <br>      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"        border="0">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In        particular, a number of additional books are included (which are        generally considered as pseudo-canonical or apocryphal by Protestants).        Some canonical books also occur under different names and the order of        chapters and verses may also vary. </p>      <p>You may have noticed the two buttons above the book list: one says        Exclude and the other says Include. These are "radio buttons": clicking        on one un-clicks the other; they are an either/or choice. If you select        <strong>Include (the listed books)</strong>, then any books showing in        the listbox will be included in the final search. On the other hand, if        you select <strong>Exclude (the listed books)</strong>, then only the        books <em>not</em> in the listbox will be included in the search . At        any time, if you click on <strong>Reinstate Books to default settings<em>,</em></strong>        <em>all</em> the books will reappear.&nbsp; So, using these simple        selection tools, you can quickly and easily narrow your search criteria.      </p>      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId296468"></a>6.3 A second way of        entering your search word</h4>      In general, I have found the method described above as the most common      method by far. However, there is a second way. If you look on the bottom      left of the application window (in the yellow area), you will see the      button: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Keyboard</span>.&nbsp;      Click on this button and a virtual keyboard will be revealed:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 662px; height: 325px;"          alt="The Virtual Keyboard"          title="The Virtual Keyboard"          src="22%20The%20Virtual%20Keyboard.png"></div>      <p><br>        As you type using this virtual keyboard, the result of your typing will        appear in the textbox near the bottom right of the area.&nbsp; When you        are satisfied that you want to use the word that you have typed, select        the relevant radio button above the textbox and it will determine where        any word you type will go. The main benefit of this keyboard is that you        can easily enter Hebrew text into your notes. However, you can also use        this to populate your search option by selecting the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary
          Search Word</span> radio button option. <br>        <br>        Of course, you "type" using the mouse. These do not respond to keyboard        presses. To get the vowels or sin/shin dot, click on the relevant        consonant first, then on the special character. If the addition is not        allowed, it will simply be ignored. <br>        <br>        You may need to experiment with this option a little. You will also need        to be careful that you have typed the word exactly.</p>      <p>We have shown the Hebrew/Aramaic keyboard but a similarly provided        Greek virtual keyboard is provided when in the LXX section.</p>      <p><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId479136"></a>6.4 Secondary Search        Criteria</p>      No doubt the hawk-eyed user has already noted several references to <span        style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary
        Searches</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Search        Words</span> You can either redirect a second typed word by selecting      the Secondary Search String radio button option on the virtual keyboard,      or you can use another search option when you right click on a selected      word in the text:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="23%20Secondary%20Selection.png"          alt="23 Secondary Selection"          height="501"          width="1314"></div>      <br>      This will then modify the search area:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="24%20Resulting%20Secondary%20Entry.png"          alt="24 Resulting Secondary Entry"          height="534"          width="1314"></div>      <br>      When you click on Perform Search you will now search for all occurrences      of the primary word that occur within n words of the secondary word: <br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="25%20Secondary%20Search%20Result.png"          alt="25 Secondary Search Result"          height="745"          width="654"></div>      <p><br>        You will need to be very patient when using this option: the search        process is a lot more complex and can take quite some time.</p>      <p>(Note, for example, the first result, where the match spans two        verses.&nbsp; It is not the most intuitive presentation and you will        need to look carefully to recognise that the two search words are        actually almost next to each other.)</p>      <p> You can vary the strictness or slackness of criteria by varying the        "distance" of the two words, up to a separation of 10 words. It will be        for you to judge how far the two words can be apart before their mutual        occurrence becomes coincidental rather than significant.&nbsp; Remember        also that "word" means something a little different: two main words        "next to each other" might actually be three or four words apart.&nbsp;        If you are searching for two related words and one is much less frequent        generally than the other, we recommend that you make the less frequent        word the Primary Word.&nbsp; That should speed the search somewhat.</p>      <p>In the example shown above, we have changed the search words to ensure        that we get a number of matches.</p>      Note, then, that this search can return matches across two or even three      verses.      <h4>6.5 Different types of search</h4>      <p>You will have noticed that, beneath the primary (and secondary) word,        there is an option to select one of three strategies for matching words:</p>      <ul>        <li>Matching BDB references;</li>        <li>Matching the exact form of the selected word (but ignoring accents);</li>        <li>Matching the exact <em>consonants</em> of the selected word.</li>      </ul>      <p>These will need a little additional explanation.</p>      <h5>6.5.1 Matching BDB references</h5>      <p>We have already explained that the source data provides us with one or        more BDB references for most words, which has allowed us to identify        potential meaning (lexical entries) for words. This option will find        other occurrences of words with one or more of the same BDB references.        Note that, since some of these references are tangential links, it may        create "matches" that are somewhat tenuous. Equally, it may create        matches that you might not expect and they could be quite fruitful. As        with much of the application, this is an aid and doesn't replace the        need for you to exercise reason and caution.</p>      <h5>6.5.2 Matching the exact form</h5>      <p>This is the strictest of the three options. This means that a search        for <font size="+2">&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (for example, from Gen 9<sup>26</sup>)        will not match <font size="+2">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> in Gen 10<sup>9</sup>,        because the two word forms have different vowels. </p>      <h5>6.5.3 Matching consonants but not vowels (or accents)</h5>      <p>This is a kind of compromise between the very loose match criteria of        the first option and the tight criteria of the second. In this case, the        two forms of the verb <em>would</em> be matched but a second person        form would still be excluded. </p>      <h5>6.5.4 Greek Matching options</h5>      <p>In Greek searches, the equivalent function is a little simpler. Here,        you can either</p>      <ul>        <li>match on base (lexical) forms - referred to as "roots" but they are          not normally true roots, or </li>        <li>identical matches (although accents are ignored). </li>      </ul>      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId739149"></a>6.6 Using the Search        Results</h4>      These search results are primarily for your information. They form a kind      of concordance. However, you can also make use of them. Right click on any      specific result and you will see the following Context Menu: <br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 654px; height: 424px;"          alt="Search pop-up menu"          title="Search pop-up menu"          src="26%20Search%20pop-up%20menu.png"></div>      <br>      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId50534"></a>6.6.1 Copy Results or        Single Result to ...</h5>      You will see that this will allow you to copy either <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>      the search results or just the specifically selected result to either      memory or to the currently active notes area.&nbsp; These two destinations      work in much the same way as §3.2 above.&nbsp; Remember that, if you copy      it to the notes area, it will be active in the note for the currently      selected verse.<br>      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId904375"></a>6.6.2 Change Text to        Selected Chapter</h5>      Again, you need to be careful where you click for this option. It will      change the book and chapter in the left (Text) pane to that of the result.      So, for example, if you select this option on the result for Genesis      18:10, it will change the text presented in the left pane to Genesis 18. <br>      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId435214"></a>7. Notes</h3>      This is the first tab in the area at the bottom right of the window.&nbsp;      This is an area where you can simply make notes about a given verse. Each      verse has its own notes area and, when you change to a different verse      (whether in the same chapter or elsewhere), the note will disappear and,      if the new destination already has a note, the new note will appear. So,      if you change something and the note disappears, don't be too worried:      moving back to the original verse should restore the note as well.<br>      <br>      We will learn more about notes in section 9.2 below. <br>      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId316927"></a>8.

We collect all the notes      together to form a Note Set. OTS allows you to have more than one Note Set      but you can only have one Note Set active at any one time.<br>      <br>      Out of the box, OTS comes with a single Note Set for each language called      default. Additional menu options under the Manage Notes option allows you      modify your use of notes:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 638px; height: 431px;"          alt="Main menu - Notes"          title="Main menu - Notes"          src="31%20Main%20menu%20-%20Notes.png"></div>      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId726587"></a>8.2.1 Create a New Note        Set</h5>      <br>      Selecting this option will open a dialog to allow you to create a new Note      Set:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 704px; height: 371px;"          alt="New Note Set"          title="New Note Set"          src="32%20New%20Note%20Set.png"></div>      <br>      You'll see that I've given the new Note Set a name. All I now have to do      is OK it.<br>      <br>      This not only creates the new Note Set but changes the currently active      Set to this new one. You can check this out by looking at the tab in the      bottom right area of the application.<br>      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId593665"></a>8.2.2 Choose a different        Note Set</h5>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 661px; height: 332px;"          alt="Different Note Set"          title="Different Note Set"          src="33%20Different%20Note%20Set.png"></div>      <br>      The currently active Note Set is lower down the dialog, in red. The      listbox gives you a list of all other Note Sets that are available. Select      the one you want and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> and      your Note Set will be changed.<br>      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId612667"></a>8.2.3 Delete an existing        Note Set</h5>      This is a logical complement to the other tasks and functions pretty much      as you'd expect:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 648px; height: 319px;"          alt="Delete a Note Set"          title="Delete a Note Set"          src="34%20Delete%20a%20Note%20Set.png"><br>        <br>        <div style="text-align: left;">Note that the current Note Set is not          included in the list that can be deleted. If you want to delete the          current set, you must change to another Set first. The logical          consequence of this is that you must always have at least one Note Set          within OTS. (If you are enterprising and manage to delete all note          sets outside the application, OTS will create a new, empty Note Set          called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Default</span> next time you          run the application.<br>          <br>          Beware: deleting the note set will destroy any data you have created          within that set.<br>          <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId889597"></a>8.2.4 Show the            current Note Set name</h5>          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 819px; height: 607px;"              alt="Current Note Set"              title="Current Note Set"              src="35%20Current%20Note%20Set.png"></div>        </div>      </div>      This option will show the current Notes Set names for both BHS and      LXX.&nbsp; It will also show the names of any other Note Sets that are      currently active on your system.<br>      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId989125"></a>9.

We will assume that you are familiar with resizing      windows (and click-and-drag actions, in particular) and, if you are not,      we recommend that you read a book on using your operating system.&nbsp;      The application will remember any changes you make to the size and      position of the main window and will open it to look the same the next      time you use OTS.&nbsp; In order to make sure this is the case, we suggest      that you always use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Close</span>      button. <br>      <br>      The window is divided into two halves and, between the main text area and      the collection of small panes on the right hand side, there is a Splitter      Bar. Slowly move your mouse from the main text area across to the right      and, as you cross the divider, the cursor shape should change. At the      point the curser has changed you can click and drag the bar with your      mouse. The benefit of this change is that you can maximise the area in      which you have main interest.&nbsp; The position of the splitter bar will      also be remembered between sessions.<br>      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId256711"></a>11 Adjusting the        right-hand Pane</h3>      The one control on the top tool bar that we haven't discussed so far can      also be found on the main menu, under <strong>View</strong>:<br>      <br>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 633px; height: 431px;"          alt="Equalise"          title="Equalise"          src="38%20Equalise.PNG"></div>      <br>      The purpose of this feature is to enable you to easily manage the      information in the various sections on the right-hand side of the      application. Sometimes you may want to concentrate on information in the      top panel (e.g. Search Results) and at other times you may want to focus      on the lower panel (e.g. if creating a complex note). This feature will      enable you to resize these sub-panels in a controlled fashion.<br>      <br>      There are actually <em>three</em> options available.&nbsp; These are:<br>      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId37642"></a>11.1 Maximise Top Right        Pane</h4>      In other words, reduce the bottom panel to an absolute minimum and allow      you to focus on the top panel. To use this option, simply click on the      down arrow beside the Resize control and select the Minimise Bottom      option:<br>      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId556069"></a>11.2 Maximise Bottom        Right Pane</h4>      This has a similar effect but works in the other direction.<br>      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId763988"></a>11.3 Equalise Both Right        Panes</h4>      This will restore the dividing bar between the two sub-panels to the      mid-point vertically. This means that both the top and bottom panel on the      right hand side will be roughly the same size.<br>      <br>      You are still able to resize these panels manually by clicking on the      Splitter Bar and dragging it into the desired position.</div>    <div style="text-align: left;"><br>    </div>    <div style="text-align: left;">It should be noted, however, that only two of      these options are visible at any time.&nbsp; The third, hidden option is      the one that would leave you as you are.&nbsp; So, only options that      change the state of the right hand areas are visible in the View menu      options.<br>      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId643709"></a>12.
